RNN, MLP,

to deal with vanishing gradients within the backpropalgoruthm.
batch normalization
have you considered other architectures, like LSTM


what sort of optimizer are you thinking about for 




probabilities.

feedback:
minimizetext on page, easier to follow
simplify the explaination of the model, 
mention other types that could be applicable for this project (which model is best and why).
table of content
add input and output.
add visualization in cartesian and joint space.
