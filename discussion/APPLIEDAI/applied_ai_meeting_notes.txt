FUNC(JOINTS) --> 3D INPUT, coppelia has this function built "Fk"



MODEL1
problem: extend from 2d to 3d, and debug it, then change the plots to 3d plots.

in: (t, x1, x2)   -> out: (t,x1,x2)
WORK: 
in: (t, x1, x2,x3) -> out: (t,x1,x2,x3)


MODEL2
problem: we don't knw what the input is, I guess they are angles joints. but I am not sure


in: (t, theta1, theta2,... ,thetaN)
t= 1: 0.2 0.3 
0.4 0.5
...
t= T
