run FIT.

1) align: puts each demostration as consecutive to each other. 
input (7,50,6) --> (350, 6)

2) use PCA:
input (350, 6) --> (350, 3)     #timestep, dim_features

3) given inputs of different time steps, we keep track an index that remembers which demonstration a datapoint belongs to.

4) concatenates timestep as an additional feature
 --> (350,4)    # (3pca dims, 1 timestep)

5) select number of Gaussians (grid search of 10 values)
C

6) run EM to find parameters (mu, sigma) for each Gaussian.


7) initialize GMR
centers general (C, 4) 
        centers(spatial_latent) C,3    # part of general
        centers _temporal (C,1         # part of general
centers spatial (C, 6) used pca inverse transform  # in the joint space (
